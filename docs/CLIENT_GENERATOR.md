- Embed public key
- Set API endpoint
- Custom branding URLs
- Company copyright information

#### Security

- Theme selection (Follow System, Light, Dark)
- Theme override options

#### Permissions
- Granular control over features:
  - Keyboard/mouse control
  - Clipboard sharing
  - File transfer
  - Audio transmission
  - TCP tunneling
  - Remote restart
  - Session recording
  - Block user input

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Generator
Navigate to "Client Generator" in the sidebar menu of the BetterDesk Console.

### 2. Select Platform
Click on the desired platform icon (Windows, Linux, Android, or macOS).

### 3. Choose Version
Select the RustDesk version you want to customize.

### 4. Configure Settings
Fill in the configuration options based on your requirements:
- Enter server details if using a custom server
- Set security options
- Upload custom icons/logos if desired
- Configure permissions
- Add any custom settings in JSON format

### 5. Generate Client
Click the "Generate Custom Client" button. The system will:
1. Download the base RustDesk client
2. Apply your configuration
3. Package the customized client
4. Provide a download link

### 6. Download and Deploy
Once generation is complete, download the custom client and distribute it to your users.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Download Base Client**: The generator fetches the official RustDesk client from GitHub releases.

2. **Configuration Injection**: Your settings are converted to RustDesk's configuration format (TOML).

3. **Client Modification**: The configuration is embedded or packaged with the client.

4. **Output Generation**: The customized client is packaged and made available for download.

### File Storage

- Generated clients are stored in `/tmp/rustdesk_builds/`
- Uploaded icons/logos are stored in `/tmp/rustdesk_uploads/`
- Files older than 24 hours are automatically cleaned up

### Security

- Only authenticated users can access the generator
- All actions are logged in the audit log
- File uploads are restricted to .png format
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Filenames are sanitized to prevent directory traversal

## Configuration Format

### Default Settings (JSON)
```json
{
  "view_style": "original",
  "scroll_style": "scrollauto",
  "image_quality": "balanced"
}
```

### Override Settings (JSON)
```json
{
  "options": {
    "enable-audio": "N",
    "enable-clipboard": "Y"
  }
}
```

## Limitations

### Current Implementation
The current implementation provides basic configuration embedding. For production use, consider:

1. **Code Signing**: Sign the executables with your organization's certificate
2. **Advanced Customization**: Modify source code for deeper changes
3. **Branding**: Replace icons and resources in the executable
4. **Compilation**: Build from source for maximum customization

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows**: Configuration can be embedded as a companion .toml file
- **Linux**: AppImage allows configuration overlay
- **Android**: APK modification requires signing with your certificate
- **macOS**: DMG modification may require code signing

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test generated clients in a safe environment before deployment
2. **Version Control**: Keep track of which configurations you've deployed
3. **Security**: Use strong permanent passwords if enabling this feature
4. **Permissions**: Only grant minimum necessary permissions
5. **Updates**: Regularly generate new clients with latest RustDesk versions

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Fails
- Check internet connection (required to download base clients)
- Verify RustDesk version is available on GitHub
- Check disk space in `/tmp/`

### Client Doesn't Connect
- Verify server host is correct
- Check public key matches your server
- Ensure firewall allows required ports

### Configuration Not Applied
- Verify JSON syntax in default/override settings
- Check that settings keys are valid
- Review generated metadata file (.json)

## API Integration

The generator can be accessed programmatically:

### Generate Client
```bash
POST /api/generate-client
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Form fields: platform, version, config_name, server_host, etc.
```

### Download Client
```bash
GET /api/download-client/<filename>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Source code compilation for full customization
- Code signing integration
- Batch generation for multiple platforms
- Configuration templates
- Version tracking and rollback
- Client update management
